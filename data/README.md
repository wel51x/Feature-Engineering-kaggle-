# Feature-Engineering-kaggle-data
Data for the exercises

Note that ks-projects-201801-1.csv through ks-projects-201801-3.csv should be merged into ks-projects-201801.csv

GitHub in its infinite wisdom doesn't allow files > 25MB, hence the split.

files in the feature-engineering-data directory will have to be downloaded from kaggle as it's too much work to split them up
